# Portfolio

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. The purpose of this repo is showing my analytical and technical skills regarding Python, SQL and data visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau or Dash.

Some of my best projects are:
* [COVID dashboard on plotly](https://github.com/aingelmo/portfolio/tree/main/covid_heroku)
* [Usage patterns in Ford GoBike bicycle sharing - A data visualization approach](https://aingelmo.github.io/blog/bikesharing-data)

Hope you like it!
