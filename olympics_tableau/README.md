# History of the Olympic Games in Tableau

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard showing the differences between different countries in the history of Olympic Games since 1896 until 2021.

## Datasets

Datasets come from Kaggle:

* [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results by rgriffin](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
* [Tokyo 2020 Olympics by Petro](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm/tokyo-2020-olympics)

As the information were not together so I had to combine and clean them with Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Wrangling

The data came from multiple sources so wrangling it was neccesary. There is a notebook in the folder called `data-wrangling.ipynb` showing all the steps performed to clean and merge the data.

## Visualization

The data visualization is built on Tableau. You can check it out [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aingelmop/viz/OlympicGamesVisualization/MainDashboard).
