During the data analyst nanodegree, I carried out five projects: 
  1. Explore Weather Trends: Retrieve data with SQL queries and perform simple analysis using Excel.
  2. Investigate a Dataset: Load, clean and analyze data with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib about the popular website "IMDb".
  3. Analyze AB Test: Perform AB testing with Pandas on an Udacity dataset.
  4. Wrangle and Analyze Data: Retrieve data from WeRateDogs Twitter with the API and perform a full analysis.
