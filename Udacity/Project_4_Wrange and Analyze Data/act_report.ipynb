    "The graph above shows the amount of tweets posted by the account between November 15th, 2015 and August 1st, 2017. The distribution is right skewed so more tweets were posted in the early stages of the account. This might be related to the fact they were less known by that time. Some social media profiles, as they began to be more known, they stop releasing content so frequently as, in some cases, it can reduce the quality of it.\n",

    "It is a really interesting fact knowing about the tweets frequency but you may be wondering, what is the **most common dog breed posted in WeRateDogs?** To answer this, well analyze data from a neural network.

    "The most common dog breed identified by the algorithm was the golden retriever with almost 150 results. It is follow by the labrador retriever with 100 and the pembroke, also known as corgi, with 89. But, can we say that golden retriever is the most common dog breed posted in WeRateDogs? Of course not. We do not have enough evicende to support that hypothesis. The data we analyzed was only from 2015 to 2017. They may be biased when posting content about this type of dogs. Maybe they attract more audience, maybe they look more cute... we don't know that for sure based on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know they like to post pictures of golden retrievers, labrador retrievers an corgis. Let's find out their **most popular tweets** within that range. Their most retweeted tweet is a [doggo realizing he can stand in the pool](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/744234799360020481). How cool is that? It has almost 150K retweets by the time I'm writing this! \n",

    "To finish this analysis, we ran a test to know if the **most popular breeds made the most popular tweets** and we were very surpised with the results. The golden retriever, chihuahua and labrador retriever were in that list. And this is not a coincidence. WeRateDogs knows what the people like, what we demand as consumers. And they deliver. \n",

    "They know that our favourite dogs are the goldens, labradors and corgis and they post about them. The probabilities of going viral with one of those breeds seem to be higher than others.
