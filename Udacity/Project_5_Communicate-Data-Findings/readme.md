# Project 5: Communicate Data Findings

# Usage patterns in Ford Gobike bycicle sharing

## by Andr√©s Ingelmo Poveda

## Dataset

The dataset includes 180,000+ observations regarding individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco area during the month of February 2019. The dataset can be found [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv).

## Summary of Findings

The average ride in this bike-sharing system was around 500 seconds (or 8.5 minutes). However, this varied depending on the day of the week, the hour, the user type...

We discovered than most of the users are subscribers, males, born in the 80s and 90s and ride the bike between Monday and Friday at 8 or 9 in the morning or 17 or 18 in the afternoon. However, this is the average user. Longers rides were linked with non-subscribers and weekends. Possibly due to different usages of the bike. Subscribers take the bike during weekdays to commute while customers take the bike on weekends for fun.

Other insightful finding was how the year of birth affected the bike usage. It seems that older people spend more time riding the bike. While this can be related to the fact that old people may ride slower, retirement can also take part into this. The more time they have, the more time they can spend in the bike.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on how presenting the distribution of the bike duration, decade of birth, weekdays and hours. This is important to know the structure of the dataset and understand the conclusions.

After that, I move onto presenting the average duration of the ride depending on the user type and how the user type is distributed depending on the year of birth and gender.

To conclude, I show the difference in the duration of the rides depending on the weekdays for the type of users and genres. This is the most important summary of the whole presentation. After that, I show how the year users are born impacts on the usage and how subscribers use the bike in a whole different way than customers.
