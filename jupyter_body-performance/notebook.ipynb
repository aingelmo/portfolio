Despite this technique wasn't really needed to carry on the analysis, it showed five different groups with common characteristics.\n\nFrom the data analyzed, we can draw the conclusion that body performance decreases during the years and males and females have different strenghts. In this case, females were more flexible while males did better in strenght tests.\n\nAlso, a higher bodyfat can lead to bad body performance and higher blood pressure. ","metadata":{}}]}
